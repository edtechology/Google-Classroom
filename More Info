# What else can you do with Google Classroom
# In the beginning, we named the course "sandbox" to get started in building the Class. The Class name is a required field when you are creating a class. Here is where you can add more specific details about the class. However, other details may or may not be necessary. For example, if you teach more than one class, have multiple sections of courses, or want to have a separate Google Class for each subject you teach in the elementary classroom adding other details may be useful. If you are facilitating a student club, an extra-curricular project, or teacher professional learning community, you can create a Class to communicate, share resources, and provide a digital learning environment for participants. (See also the Google Groups course to learn more about other options)
